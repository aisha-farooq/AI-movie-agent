AI Movie Production Agent ðŸŽ¬
Overview
The AI Movie Production Agent is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users develop movie concepts with the assistance of AI agents. It integrates Claude Sonnet 3.5 from Anthropic for screenplay writing, SerpAPI for real-time actor search and availability, and a custom Movie Producer agent to oversee the script and casting process.

This tool is designed to automate the process of generating a movie script outline, casting suggestions, and a concise movie concept overview. Whether you are an aspiring filmmaker, a movie enthusiast, or someone who loves creative storytelling, this app can help bring your movie ideas to life.

Features
Script Writing: The ScriptWriter assistant generates a compelling movie script outline with character descriptions, key plot points, and a three-act structure.

Casting Suggestions: The CastingDirector assistant suggests 2-3 actors for each main role based on past performances and current availability, using real-time data from SerpAPI.

Movie Concept Overview: The MovieProducer assistant orchestrates the workflow by coordinating between the ScriptWriter and CastingDirector, summarizing both the script and casting suggestions into a movie concept overview.

Customizable Inputs: Users can input their movie idea, select the genre, target audience, and estimated runtime, and receive a detailed movie concept.
