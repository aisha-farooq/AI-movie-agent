# AI Movie Production Agent ðŸŽ¬

## Overview

The **AI Movie Production Agent** is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users develop movie concepts with the assistance of AI agents. It integrates **Claude Sonnet 3.5** from Anthropic for screenplay writing, **SerpAPI** for real-time actor search and availability, and a custom **Movie Producer** agent to oversee the script and casting process.

This tool is designed to automate the process of generating a movie script outline, casting suggestions, and a concise movie concept overview. Whether you are an aspiring filmmaker, a movie enthusiast, or someone who loves creative storytelling, this app can help bring your movie ideas to life.

## Features

- **Script Writing**: The ScriptWriter assistant generates a compelling movie script outline with character descriptions, key plot points, and a three-act structure.
  
- **Casting Suggestions**: The CastingDirector assistant suggests 2-3 actors for each main role based on past performances and current availability, using real-time data from SerpAPI.
  
- **Movie Concept Overview**: The MovieProducer assistant orchestrates the workflow by coordinating between the ScriptWriter and CastingDirector, summarizing both the script and casting suggestions into a movie concept overview.

- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can input their movie idea, select the genre, target audience, and estimated runtime, and receive a detailed movie concept.
